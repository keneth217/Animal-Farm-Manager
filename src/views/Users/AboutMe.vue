                    <p>I am a Software Student and a Lifelong Learner .I am a self-taught programmer who firmly believes that you can
                        accomplish
                        anything in this life if you put your mind to it, roll up your sleeves and are willing to put in the
                        work. </p>
                    <p> This path is challenging, and as many would attest, it is not an easy journey.
                        Nevertheless, what stands out is our collective resilienceâ€”the unwavering commitment to soldier on.
                    </p>
                    <p>I have been writing software for over 4+ years now and I use my knowledge, passion, and influence to
                        help other developers achieve their goals.</p>
                    <h3 class="text-primary">My Journey.</h3>
                    <p> My journey to becoming a computer programmer started years ago in university.
                        Thanks to my parents, for taking me to school, I have done some freelancing and
                        internship in some organisations to hone my skills.
                        My educational journey did not stop there.
                        I consider myself a lifelong learner. Having a passion
                        for
                        learning is the secret to success in life.</p>
                    <p> I spent most of my nights
                        immersing myself in programming books to advance my skills, which certainly will pay off!
                        I have continued to advance to different positions and companies over the
                        years, and here I am, 4+ years later, still loving to code every single day. </p>
                    <h3 class="text-primary">One thing that has always stuck with me.</h3>
                    <p>One thing that has always stuck with me over the years is how grateful I am for all of the people who
                        taught and inspired me. This inspired me to share my passion for learning with others. As I
                        said in the beginning, if you are willing to put in the work,you can accomplish anything in this
                        life. If programming is what you are hoping to learn and work hard on, I
                        am happy to show you the way! </p>
                    <h3 class="text-primary">Some other facts about me.</h3>
                    <p>
                        When
                        not spending time with my family, I love reading books, listening to podcasts, and watching online
                        courses. I have a real thirst for knowledge and it consumes me every day of the week. I also love to
                        run
                        and lift heavy weights, which keeps me balanced throughout the week.
